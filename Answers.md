1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

    React is used mainly in creating user interfaces, and draws from its own user interface library. 


2. What does it mean to think in react?

    To problem-solve through using repeated patterns of components that can be used over and over again. 

3. Describe state.

    State is the default part of an app. Each component can have its own state, and each component's state (and thus the app) can also be changed.

4. Describe props.

    A prop is a bit of information that we move from one component to another without changing. 

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

    Side effects affect anything outside the scope of the function currently being executed. We can sync side effects by passing dependency arrays as secondary effect hooks, and thus avoid the infinite loop.
